 * Base class for WebDAV exceptions.
 * <p>
 * These are RuntimeExeptions to work around a limitation of Milton. Many operations don't allow
 * exceptions to be thrown. Hence our only chance to report an error is to throw a RuntimeException.
 * However throwing RuntimeException directly will result in an "Internal Server Error" being
 * reported back to the client. Therefore we catch these exception in DcacheStandardFilter and
 * respond with appropriate error codes.
